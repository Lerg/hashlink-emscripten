I've tried compiling a Heaps game to WASM with emscripten and uploaded my results here.

A simple Heaps app in the `/app` directory. Hashlink for emscripten in the `/hashlinkg-emscripten` directory.

When running the project it quickly fails with an exception when it gets to the C part.

This happens around `hl_global_init()` function call in `hlc_main.c:128`

To compile hashlink with Emscripten a few changes were made to its `CMakeList.txt` and a few other files. Mainly to include emscript ports of SDL, zlib, libpng, libjpeg and Ogg/Vorbis libs.

Install emscripten SDK and run
```
emcmake cmake .
emmake make
```
to build Hashlink.

Still after compilation there are a few missing symbols, but hopefully they are not so important to run a test project:

```

To compile the Heaps app, first compile it to C with `haxe hl.hxml` then run `build_html5.sh`.

Run a local web server with `emrun --port 8000 --no_browser out_html5/index.html`

For convenience all binaries are included.
